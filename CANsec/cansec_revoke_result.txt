Derivation:

1. We assume as hypothesis that
attacker(m_1).

2. The message k_A[] may be sent to the attacker at output {4}.
attacker(k_A[]).

3. Using the function 0 the attacker may obtain 0.
attacker(0).

4. We assume as hypothesis that

5. By 1, the attacker may know m_1.
By 2, the attacker may know k_A[].
Using the function enc the attacker may obtain enc(m_1,k_A[]).
attacker(enc(m_1,k_A[])).

6. The entry association_keys(sci_A[],0,k_A[]) may be inserted in a table at insert {5}.
table(association_keys(sci_A[],0,k_A[])).

7. The entry association_keys(sci_A[],0,k_A[]) that may be in a table by 6 may be read at get {16}.
So the message (sci_A[],0,1,enc(msg[],k_A[]),hmac(sci_A[],enc(msg[],k_A[]),1,0,k_A[])) may be sent to the attacker at output {15}.
attacker((sci_A[],0,1,enc(msg[],k_A[]),hmac(sci_A[],enc(msg[],k_A[]),1,0,k_A[]))).

8. By 7, the attacker may know (sci_A[],0,1,enc(msg[],k_A[]),hmac(sci_A[],enc(msg[],k_A[]),1,0,k_A[])).
Using the function 1-proj-5-tuple the attacker may obtain sci_A[].
attacker(sci_A[]).

9. By 8, the attacker may know sci_A[].
By 5, the attacker may know enc(m_1,k_A[]).
By 4, the attacker may know fresh_2.
By 3, the attacker may know 0.

The entry association_keys(sci_A[],0,k_A[]) that may be in a table by 6 may be read at get {24}.
So event message_received_B(m_1,fresh_2) may be executed at {22}.
